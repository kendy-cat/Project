      <h2> My Bio: </h2>
      <p>
      Hello world! My name is Kendra. I am 17 years old (in August 2019) and an incoming High School Senior. I have a Dog named Freckles; he is a Boxer / Great Dane / Rhodesian Ridgeback mix. I also have a sister named Arianna. She is 19 and going to college near our house. My parents are so sweet and funny, I hope to be just like them someday!  I love painting and coming up with crazy ideas about fantasy worlds. I hope to be an Animator or Game designer in the future. I would love to work at Blizzard Irvine and share my ideas with the world.
